**A new visual editor for authoring and debugging workflows.** You can now see the full execution graph of a workflow — every step, every branch, every fallback — rendered as an interactive diagram. Click any node to inspect its configuration, test it with sample data, or view recent execution logs.

**Live step-through debugging.** Feed a real case into a workflow and watch it execute step by step. At each node you can see the input, the decision logic, and the output. When something goes wrong, you can see exactly where and why.

**Natural language still comes first.** The visual editor is a companion to the natural language authoring flow, not a replacement. Describe your process in plain language, and the visual editor shows you what the system understood. Edit either representation — they stay in sync.
