**Full audit trail for every workflow execution.** Every action, decision, override, and escalation is logged with timestamps, actor identity, and the reasoning chain that led to the outcome. Designed for regulated industries where "the AI decided" isn't an acceptable answer.

**One-click compliance reports.** Generate PDF reports covering any time period — which cases were processed, what decisions were made, which were escalated to humans, and what the outcomes were. Formatted for regulatory review with no additional preparation needed.

**Role-based access controls.** Define who can author workflows, who can approve context changes, and who can view execution logs. Permissions cascade through the organisation hierarchy and can be scoped to individual workflows or departments.
