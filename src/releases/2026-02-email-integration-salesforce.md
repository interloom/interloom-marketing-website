**Full email integration.** Agents can now receive, draft replies to, and send emails directly within Interloom. Emails forwarded to an instance's Interloom domain are automatically picked up as tasks, and a postal agent generates a draft reply based on the case context. Collision detection ensures that when the same email thread is referenced across multiple cases, replies stay correctly threaded. You can review and edit the draft before sending it back out from within the platform, and agents can attach files or pull in relevant attachments using other tools. The feature supports ongoing back-and-forth conversation — each new inbound message triggers a fresh draft, so the agent keeps the dialogue going without manual intervention.

**Agent exit criteria and output separation.** Agents now reliably complete their full set of instructions, including marking tasks as done and handing over to the next person in a workflow. Previously, agents would frequently skip final steps like setting task status to completed or mentioning the next assignee, because they confused their internal thinking steps with the final output the user sees. That boundary is now enforced, so the visible output contains only what the user should see, and lifecycle actions like status changes and @-mentions are executed as discrete tool calls rather than getting lost in reasoning traces.

**Similar task matching improvements.** The similar-task engine now scores matches using a 50/50 blend of title and summary similarity, passed through a re-ranker for the final ranking. A bug that prevented embeddings from being stored correctly has been fixed — previously, even tasks with identical names would not surface as matches. Subtasks are no longer shown in the similar-cases panel, so you only see top-level cases. Summaries have also been reworked to be more problem-focused, describing the objective being resolved rather than echoing raw content, which in turn improves match quality. Summary generation is also faster thanks to a slimmer context window that excludes bulky attachments like PDFs (email contents are still included).

**Agent management tools.** Odin now has a set of tools for creating and managing agents directly from within a conversation. You can create a new agent, update an existing one, inspect which tools are available on the platform, and check which tools a specific agent has enabled. This means workflow architects can design and configure agents conversationally through Odin rather than navigating the UI manually — a foundational step toward building and iterating on procedures entirely through the assistant.

**Markdown table rendering.** The text rendering engine has been replaced with a new package that properly renders markdown tables as real HTML tables with full CSS styling support. Previously, tables generated by agents appeared as plain-text grids that were difficult to read and impossible to style. Now they render with proper borders, alignment, and formatting. The engine handles mixed content seamlessly — markdown and plain text can coexist in the same message — and supports wide tables with horizontal scrolling when columns exceed the viewport. Markdown checklists are also supported inside table cells.

**Secure secrets management.** A new secrets store lets you create, view, and delete encrypted secrets from a dedicated UI page. Secrets are sealed in the database with encryption at rest and are never retrievable by the frontend after creation — even direct database access will not expose the values. Each secret requires a unique name (no spaces, underscores for separation) and is stamped with its creator and creation date. The page is currently behind a feature flag and will eventually move into organisation or integration settings. Several customer integrations (SharePoint, API invocation tools) already use this system under the hood; the new UI simply makes it self-service.

**Salesforce integration.** A new set of tools — create, update, and query — lets agents interact with Salesforce objects directly from within Interloom. You can instruct an agent to create a record with arbitrary properties, update fields on an existing record by ID, or run freeform SOQL queries to search and retrieve data across your Salesforce instance. The integration authenticates via the secrets store, requiring three configured secrets and an enabled feature flag. Under the hood, the agent composes the correct API calls and SOQL syntax autonomously, making it possible to read and write CRM data without leaving the platform.
