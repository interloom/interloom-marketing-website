**The Context Layer now learns incrementally from every processed case.** Previously, context articles had to be authored manually or imported in bulk. Now, when a workflow processes a case and a human reviewer confirms or corrects the outcome, the relevant context article is updated automatically.

This means your knowledge base improves with every case — without anyone having to maintain it as a separate task.

**Portable export.** Context articles can be exported as plain Markdown at any time. No proprietary formats, no lock-in. Move your accumulated knowledge to another system or use it in documentation — it's your data.
