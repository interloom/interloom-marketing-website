**Connect to enterprise systems without middleware.** Interloom now ships with native connectors for SAP, Salesforce, and ServiceNow. Configure credentials, map fields, and start pulling data into workflows — no Zapier, no custom API glue, no maintenance burden.

**Bi-directional sync.** Workflows can read from and write back to connected systems. Process a claim in Interloom, and the outcome is written back to your system of record. Status fields, timestamps, and audit references are all kept in sync.

**Webhook triggers.** Any connected system can trigger a workflow via webhook. A new case in ServiceNow, a status change in SAP, or a form submission in Salesforce — each can kick off the appropriate workflow automatically.
