This guide will help you get up and running with Interloom in minutes.

## Step 1: Access Your Workspace

Your Interloom workspace is available at your organization's dedicated URL. Contact your administrator if you don't have access yet.

## Step 2: Create Your First Space

Spaces are containers that group related work. To create a Space:

1. Navigate to the Spaces section in your sidebar
2. Click "Create Space"
3. Give your Space a descriptive name (e.g., "Customer Onboarding" or "Q1 Projects")
4. Set appropriate access permissions for your team

## Step 3: Create a Case

Cases are top-level work items that organize related tasks:

1. Inside your Space, click "New Case"
2. Add a title that describes the objective
3. Add instructions if needed for collaborators

## Step 4: Add Tasks

Break down your Case into actionable Tasks:

1. Within your Case, click "Add Task"
2. Give the task a clear title and instructions
3. Assign it to a team member or AI agent
4. Set the status as work progresses (open → started → completed)

## Step 5: Collaborate in Threads

Each Task has a Thread where you can:

- Post updates and questions
- Share files and documents
- Coordinate with human and AI team members
- Track progress toward completion

## Next Steps

- Learn about [Primitives](/docs/primitives/) to understand the full data model
- Check the [API Reference](/docs/api-reference/) for programmatic access
