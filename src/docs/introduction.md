Welcome to the Interloom documentation. Interloom is a knowledge and case management system designed to break complex work into digestible tasks so humans and agents can collaborate with the most relevant, up-to-date context at all times.

## What is Interloom?

Interloom enables domain experts to orchestrate AI agents and human collaborators in one unified workspace. Instead of waiting months for IT to build custom automation, you can create workflows directly—no code required.

## Quick Links

- **[Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/)** — Set up your first workspace and create your first task
- **[Primitives](/docs/primitives/)** — Understand the core concepts: Tasks, Cases, Spaces, Notes, and Files
- **[API Reference](/docs/api-reference/)** — Technical reference for developers

## Key Concepts

### Tasks and Cases
The core unit of work in Interloom. Tasks can be nested within Cases (top-level work items) and can contain subtasks at unlimited nesting levels.

### Spaces
Compartments that group related cases, tasks, notes, and files. Spaces define context and access boundaries for your team.

### Threads
The central space for conversation, updates, and artifacts of work. Users collaborate by posting messages that reflect progress toward objectives.
