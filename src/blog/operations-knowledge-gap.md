title: The Operations Knowledge Gap

description: Over 70% of operational knowledge lives in people's heads. When they leave, it leaves with them. There's a better way. Every organisation has a shadow operating system — the undocumented decisions, the tribal knowledge, the "ask Sarah, she knows how this works" moments. Interloom turns that implicit knowledge into structured, executable workflows before it walks out the door.

Every organisation has that person — the one who knows exactly how to handle the weird edge cases, which clients need special treatment, and what the undocumented process actually looks like. When they're on holiday, things slow down. When they leave, things break.

## The cost of undocumented knowledge

This isn't just an inconvenience. It's a structural risk. Insurance companies lose millions in institutional knowledge every time a senior underwriter retires. Logistics firms spend months training replacements who still can't match the intuition of the person who left.

## Why wikis and documentation fail

Companies have tried to solve this with documentation projects, knowledge bases, and wikis. These efforts fail for a predictable reason: documentation is a separate task from doing the work. When people are busy (which is always), documentation falls behind. Within months, the wiki is outdated and abandoned.

## Knowledge capture as a byproduct

The alternative is a system where knowledge capture happens as a natural byproduct of doing the work. When someone processes a case and makes a decision, the context behind that decision is captured automatically. When they correct an automated output, the correction becomes part of the knowledge base.

No separate documentation task. No dedicated "knowledge management" initiative. Just work, captured and structured as it happens.

## From individual expertise to organisational capability

The goal isn't to replace experienced people — it's to make their expertise available to the entire organisation. A junior team member, backed by 18 months of accumulated context, can handle cases that previously required a senior specialist. The specialist's knowledge hasn't been lost; it's been operationalised.
