title: Deploying AI in Regulated Industries Without Losing Sleep

description: Regulators don't care about your model's benchmark scores. They care about explainability, audit trails, and human oversight. Deploying AI in finance, healthcare, or legal services means navigating a thicket of compliance requirements that most AI tooling simply ignores. We built Interloom's audit and governance layer from day one — not as an afterthought bolted on to satisfy a checklist.

Insurance, financial services, healthcare — the industries that stand to benefit most from AI are also the ones with the strictest requirements around how decisions are made and documented.

## The explainability requirement

When a regulator asks "why was this claim denied?", you need a better answer than "the model said so." Every automated decision needs a reasoning chain: what data was considered, what rules were applied, what precedents were referenced, and what the confidence level was.

## Audit trails that actually work

Most AI tools log inputs and outputs. That's not an audit trail — it's a database. A real audit trail captures the full decision path: which workflow processed the case, which steps ran, what context was referenced, whether a human reviewed it, and what they decided.

Interloom logs all of this automatically. When you generate a compliance report, the evidence is already structured and ready for review.

## Human-in-the-loop, done right

"Human oversight" doesn't mean a person rubber-stamps every AI output. It means the system knows when to escalate — when confidence is low, when the case is unusual, when the stakes are high. And when a human intervenes, their decision feeds back into the context layer, making future automated decisions better.

## The path forward

You don't have to choose between AI efficiency and regulatory compliance. You need a system that was designed for both from the start — not one that bolts on compliance features after the fact.
