title: Why Off-the-Shelf Automation Fails for Complex Operations

description: Most automation software is designed for the general case. Your operations aren't the general case. The gap between what tools promise and what complex teams actually need is where most automation projects go to die — buried under workarounds, brittle integrations, and the quiet resignation of people who just go back to doing things manually.

Most automation software is designed for the general case. Your operations aren't the general case.

## The promise vs. reality

Vendors show demos with clean data, simple workflows, and happy-path scenarios. Your reality involves:

- Emails with attachments in 15 different formats
- Processes that vary by customer, region, or product type
- Tribal knowledge that exists only in certain employees' heads
- Edge cases that make up 30% of actual volume

## The integration trap

"Easy integration" means connecting to your systems. It doesn't mean understanding your workflows. You end up with automation that handles the easy 40% while your team still manually processes everything else.

## A different approach

What actually works is starting from the workflow — mapping how work really moves through your organization, then building automation that handles the complexity you actually have.

This takes longer to set up. But it's the difference between 40% automation and 90% automation.
