title: Why Off-the-Shelf Automation Fails for Complex Operations
date: 2025-01-07

Most automation software is designed for the general case. Your operations aren't the general case.

## The promise vs. reality

Vendors show demos with clean data, simple workflows, and happy-path scenarios. Your reality involves:

- Emails with attachments in 15 different formats
- Processes that vary by customer, region, or product type
- Tribal knowledge that exists only in certain employees' heads
- Edge cases that make up 30% of actual volume

## The integration trap

"Easy integration" means connecting to your systems. It doesn't mean understanding your workflows. You end up with automation that handles the easy 40% while your team still manually processes everything else.

## A different approach

What actually works is starting from the workflow — mapping how work really moves through your organization, then building automation that handles the complexity you actually have.

This takes longer to set up. But it's the difference between 40% automation and 90% automation.
