title: Context Is the Moat

description: AI models are commoditising fast. The durable advantage isn't the model — it's the structured context you feed it. Every few months a new model leapfrogs the last. If your competitive advantage depends on having access to the best model, you don't have a competitive advantage. What endures is the institutional knowledge you've captured, structured, and made available at the point of decision.

Every few months, a new model leapfrogs the last. GPT-4 gives way to Claude, gives way to Gemini, gives way to the next thing. If your competitive advantage depends on having access to the best model, you don't have a competitive advantage.

## The context layer thesis

What actually matters is the structured knowledge that sits between your raw data and the model. We call this the context layer — a living knowledge base of articles, precedents, and decision frameworks that your workflows reference at execution time.

Two companies can use the same model. But the one with 18 months of accumulated, structured context from thousands of processed cases will produce dramatically better outcomes. That context is proprietary, portable, and compounds over time.

## Why most companies don't have this

Because building structured context is hard. It requires:

- **A system that captures decisions**, not just data. When a senior underwriter overrides an automated decision, the reasoning needs to be captured — not just the override.
- **Incremental accumulation.** You can't build a useful knowledge base in a weekend workshop. It grows case by case, correction by correction.
- **Human-readable format.** If your context is trapped in vector embeddings, no one can audit it, improve it, or port it elsewhere.

## The compounding effect

Every case your team processes makes the next case slightly easier. Over months, this compounds into something no competitor can replicate by simply buying a better model or hiring more consultants.

The model is the engine. The context is the fuel. Invest accordingly.
