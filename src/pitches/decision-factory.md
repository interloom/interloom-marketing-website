### Claims sit in spreadsheets and email

Claims teams know what good resolutions look like, but can't build the systems to scale them. Engineering backlogs are 6 months deep. Your best adjusters spend their days copying data between tools instead of evaluating claims.

### You build it. Your way.

Connect your claims data, show Interloom your best decisions, and build workflows that match how your team actually works—not how some vendor thinks you should. If you can work a spreadsheet, you can build a decision factory.

### It learns from every case

As your team resolves claims, Interloom learns patterns. What started as a workflow becomes a decision engine trained on your best outcomes. The system gets smarter with every claim you process.
