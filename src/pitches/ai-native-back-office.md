Software may have eaten parts of the world, but in the industries that keep it running — insurance, logistics, real estate management, construction, manufacturing — digitalisation remains superficial. The raw capability of AI is soaring, yet it's almost nowhere to be found in production workflows.

**The core issue is a lack of unified context.** Over 70% of knowledge work happens in departmental silos, scattered across tools, documents, emails, and meetings. Tasks get done, but knowledge is lost — undocumented, unstructured, impossible to re-use. In a world with only human expertise this slows you down. **In a world with abundant artificial intelligence it's a critical point of failure.**

# Workflows That Learn

**Workflows**
Workflows are authored in natural language — with code where needed — and execute complex, multi-step processes. Each workflow can combine LLM-based steps (extraction, classification, summarisation) with deterministic ones (validation, formatting, lookups), using each where it's strongest.

**Context Layer**
The Context Layer is a corporate knowledge base, structured as human-readable articles similar to a wiki. It provides grounding context to every workflow at execution time. It's built incrementally as workflows process cases, or imported from existing sources — and it's fully portable, never locked in proprietary representations.

*Design workflows that read from and write back to your organisation's knowledge layer. Every case processed makes the next one smarter.*

**Simplicity** Traditional workflow tools force you to think like an engineer — mapping every branch, coding every integration, maintaining every edge case. Interloom flips this. You describe your process in natural language: what comes in, what should happen, when to escalate, what good looks like. The system handles the execution logic.

**Learning** As each case is worked, Interloom detects patterns, remembers outcomes, and builds a memory layer that grounds future decisions in the best precedent. Your operations get sharper over time — not because the system rewrites itself, but because it accumulates context.

**Instant setup** Subject matter experts can stand up their own workflows in minutes. Connect real case data from existing systems, describe the outcome you want, and let Interloom orchestrate both human experts and AI agents across the process. From zero to production in days, not months.

**For Enterprise** Every action, decision, and override is logged in a full audit trail. Role-based access controls ensure the right people see the right data — and nothing more. Whether you're responding to an internal review or a regulatory audit, the evidence is already there.
