## How it works

We embed with your claims team, map your actual workflows, then build and deploy automation that fits how you process claims.

Unlike off-the-shelf insurance software that forces you to adapt, or consultants who leave you with a PowerPoint, you get a working system deployed in your environment, trained on your data.

**What you get:**
- A custom-built claims system deployed in your environment
- Trained on your actual claims data and workflows
- Ongoing optimization as regulations and needs evolve
