### Expertise walks out the door

When your best consultants leave, their knowledge goes with them. Every new project starts from scratch. Your team reinvents solutions that were already solved last year. Experience doesn't compound—it evaporates.

### Build precedent, not just tickets

Interloom captures decisions, outcomes, and the reasoning behind them. Future cases match against proven precedents, not blank slates. Your best work becomes the foundation for everything that follows.

### Compound your expertise

Each resolved case strengthens your memory layer. New team members start with years of institutional knowledge, not training manuals. What took you 5 years to learn takes them 5 minutes to access.
