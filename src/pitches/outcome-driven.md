### Every ticket feels unique

10,000 support requests per month. Each one feels different. Your team reinvents solutions daily. Quality varies by agent. There's no way to capture what works and make it repeatable. Expertise doesn't scale.

As you resolve more cases, the platform learns what works. Average resolution time drops. Quality scores rise. Knowledge compounds. Next month's baseline is this month's best performance.
