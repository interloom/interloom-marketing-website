### Alert fatigue is crushing your team

Thousands of alerts per day. Most are noise. Your analysts are drowning in false positives while real threats slip through. Tribal knowledge determines who catches what. Response quality varies by shift. Critical context is scattered across tools.

### Patterns surface. Threats become visible.

Interloom correlates signals across your security stack—SIEM, EDR, identity, cloud. Anomalies that span systems become clear. Your best analyst's intuition becomes repeatable detection logic. False positives are automatically suppressed while genuine threats are escalated with full context.

### Response becomes consistent. Knowledge compounds.

Every incident response follows proven playbooks. Actions are logged, outcomes are tracked. What worked against yesterday's threat informs tomorrow's response. Your security posture improves with every incident—whether it's a phishing attempt or a sophisticated breach attempt.
